Bear
====

Bear is an experiment in language parsing and compilation. It's loosely based on Go, D, and C. Syntax analysis has been implemented with an LL(1) parser. Structures haven't been added to the language yet but will be added after semantic analysis has been done and when something runnable has been added (either an interpretation or code generation stage).
